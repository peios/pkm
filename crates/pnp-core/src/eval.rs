//! The evaluation algorithm (ratified design, PEI-598):
//!
//! 1. Matching reads the immutable snapshot.
//! 2. Trigger set: a node triggers iff it and all ancestors match and no
//!    child matches (shadowing exists only within a lineage).
//! 3. Every triggered rule's side effects execute — priority never
//!    suppresses side effects. Reports dedup per rule and honor the
//!    reporting threshold. Prompts are issued; with no handler answer the
//!    fallback applies (v0 has no handler transport, so every prompt takes
//!    the unanswered path immediately).
//! 4. A triggered rule yielding no verdict walks up its own parentage to
//!    the first ancestor whose actions contain a direct verdict; that
//!    ancestor speaks for the region, executing its full action list once.
//! 5. Collation: highest priority wins; ties resolve strictest
//!    (DROP > REJECT > PASS). Attribution is the yielding rule's path.
//! 6. Nothing yielded anywhere: DROP, attributed to the backstop.
//!
//! Effects are computed here and applied by the glue after collation —
//! so a COUNT lands after this evaluation's own reads (temporal feedback:
//! the next packet sees it), and a REPORT can carry the verdict.
