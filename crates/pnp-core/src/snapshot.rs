//! The immutable fact snapshot one traversal is judged against.
//!
//! Ratified law: matching reads a snapshot taken before evaluation; nothing
//! written during an evaluation is visible to that same evaluation's
//! matching. A fact the packet does not have is simply `None`, and the
//! absent-fact law makes every condition over it false.
//!
//! The glue that builds a snapshot is responsible for the visibility laws:
//! a RawPacket-seat snapshot must carry no `flow_state` and no `tags` (they
//! do not exist there / would be downward reads); a Packet-seat snapshot
//! carries whatever conntrack and prior packets attached. Machinery facts
//! (flow tags, counter views) are resolved by the glue against the forest
//! being evaluated: tags by name hash, counter views by their index in the
//! forest's view table.
