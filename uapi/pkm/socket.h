/*
 * KACS socket options — peer identity on local sockets.
 *
 * KACS captures a connecting client's identity onto the accepted end of an
 * AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM / SOCK_SEQPACKET connection at connect(). This header
 * is the setsockopt(2)/getsockopt(2) surface through which that identity is
 * bounded and read back. Every option lives under one option level,
 * SOL_KACS, which the kernel dispatches ahead of the protocol's own
 * setsockopt/getsockopt (net/socket.c), so the options behave identically
 * on every socket family that supports them.
 *
 * SOL_KACS is 4096: far above the upstream SOL_* range, which grows by one
 * per new protocol, so it cannot collide with a future Linux level.
 *
 * Errors: -ENOPROTOOPT for an option this level does not define (or a
 * get-only option passed to setsockopt); -EOPNOTSUPP on a socket family KACS
 * does not carry identity on (and, for the register, on a socket type that
 * has none); -EINVAL for a short optlen or an out-of-range value; -EFAULT
 * for an unreadable/unwritable optval.

 * connect() — on the accepted end with the client's identity, on the
 * connecting end with the listener's identity as captured at listen() (at
 * KACS_IMLEVEL_IDENTIFICATION unless the listener set its own level) — and
 * advanced by each KACS_SCM_TOKEN the reader's position passes (a token
 * still queued but unread is not yet visible). Every call returns a fresh
 * fd to an immutable snapshot; two calls may name different tokens, but no

 * store after a restart, or from a broker), so that clients see the

 * that governs the socket's traffic for network policy — stamped at

 * activation, descriptor passing) is governed as that program's. The

 * Ancillary message type, at cmsg_level SOL_KACS. Data: one int.

 * Received: a token fd (TOKEN_QUERY | TOKEN_IMPERSONATE, O_CLOEXEC) for the
 * identity the kernel attests sent the accompanying data. Delivered when the
 * receive buffer has room for it and the conveyed identity differs from the
 * reader's register; a receiver that reads no ancillary data still has the
 * register (KACS_SO_PEER_TOKEN).
 *
 * Sent: a token fd the sender wishes to attach to the data. The kernel
 * gates the send as if the sender were impersonating that token: the
 * two-gate model runs with the sender as installer, and an attach that would
 * lower the token's level fails with -EPERM rather than downgrading. A
 * primary token is derived to an impersonation token at this end's level.
 * The fd must carry TOKEN_IMPERSONATE (-EACCES otherwise); at most one per
 * message (-EINVAL). Attaching is exactly equivalent to impersonating the
 * token for the duration of the send.
