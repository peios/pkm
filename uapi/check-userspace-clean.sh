# The headers must compile with an ordinary, non-kernel C compiler — the
# precondition for the cgo -godefs binding generator and for any userspace
# consumer of the PKM ABI. <linux/types.h> / <linux/ioctl.h> resolve to the
# host's /usr/include (the same userspace sysroot cgo builds against), NOT
# the kernel tree; no -D__KERNEL__, no kernel include paths.
#
# Two checks:
#   1. each header compiles standalone — catches a header that only works
#      because some other header was included before it;
#   2. the umbrella <pkm/pkm.h> compiles as a full translation unit, with
#      its internal-consistency assertions (see smoke_test.c).
